## Survey on previous works and their problems/issues
- [IntelliJ Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/business/) [1]:
  - Comes with the paid version of IntelliJ for $16.90 per month
  - Smarter and interactive, you click on a package and it generates the diagram
  - Able to edit contents within the diagram
- [UML Generator](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15124-uml-generator) (Existing IntelliJ plugin) [2]:
  - Canâ€™t edit the contents within the boxes, can only delete the boxes
  - If there are enough boxes, then the connectors overlap with the boxes
  - Creates associations with DataTypes from the default Java library, which are not needed
- [Magic UML](https://github.com/xukmin/magicuml) [3]:
  - A GitHub project from 7 years ago
  - Does not have a GUI
  - Seems to have to input each .java file individually in order to use it

## Functionalities
- A free software/plugin, available for every Intellij type of user
- Improves productivity by allowing the user to see the high level relations between the classes directly in the IDE
- Easier usage of code selection in diagram generation (Ask if to leave out certain classes: public, protected, etc. of the diagram)
- Simple selection of package/code from the user to generate the diagram from.

## Operations
- Choosing package(s) to use for diagram generation
- Visualize/display relationships between classes
- Allow editing of diagram generation layout when choosing package
- Selection of code to be used in diagram(s) (getters, setters, etc.)
- Let the user add constraints to the diagram.
